# Multi Bot Test
> Name subject to change

# Overview
Multi Bot Test is an experimental project exploring a modular architecture for Discord bots that allows multiple independent bot "cores" to run within a single shared process and connection.

Rather than running multiple bots as separate Node.js processes—or combining everything into a single monolithic codebase—this project aims to provide a middle ground: modular, self-contained bots that can coexist, share state, and interact without unnecessary overhead.
